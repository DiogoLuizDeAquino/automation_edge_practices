|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **InsereUsuÃ¡rios** | Reads user data from a source (e.g., a CSV file or database) that contains the information required to fill the form.                 |
| **Stream lookup Get Variables** | Retrieves additional variables or performs lookups to enrich the user data before form submission.                                    |

| **Startloop Web Composite** | Initiates a loop to process multiple user records. This step suggests that a "Web Composite" component encapsulates the entire form-filling process for each user. |
| **Blocking Step** | Acts as a control point, potentially to pause the workflow for validation or to handle exceptions.                                    |

| **Delay row** | Introduces a delay or pause after submitting each user's data, allowing the web application to process the submission before proceeding to the next record. |

| **Filtra Estado** | Filters the dataset based on the "Estado" (State) field, potentially to segregate data by state.                                    |
| **Aguarda Gravacao** | A waiting step, likely to ensure that a previous data recording or writing operation is complete before proceeding.                |
